# Codecademy_Projects_And_Codes

This Repository contains codes that I created during my Codecademy Computer Science Career Path Course in Python.
This Repo does not contain all the codes created for this course, but instead the most important and fundamental codes that sum up the foundations of what I learned.

The Repo is broken down into 5 Folders: 1 for each Module of the course:

CS-101: Intro to Programming : There are no codes for this Repo as much of the work done here is exemplified in the CS-102 programs.

CS-102: Data Structures and Algorithims

CS-103: Databases

CS-104: Computer Architecutre 

CS-105: Discrete Math

I am currently in the middle of CS-103
