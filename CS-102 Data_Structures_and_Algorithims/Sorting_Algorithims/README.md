Here is a breakdown of the Runtimes and Space Complexity of the main Sorting Algorthims included here


                 Best Case	      Worst Case	        Average Case	        Space Complexity
Bubble Sort	      Ω(n)	            O(n^2)	              O(n^2)	                O(1)
Merge Sort	      Ω(n log n)	    O(n log n)	          O(n log n)	            O(n)
Quicksort	      Ω(n log n)	    O(n^2)	              O(n log)	                O(log n)
