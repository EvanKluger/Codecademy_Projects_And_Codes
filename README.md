# Codecademy_Projects_And_Codes

This Repository contains codes that I created during my Codecademy Computer Science Career Path Course in Python.
This Repo does not contain all the codes created for this course, but instead the most important and fundamental codes that sum up the foundations of what I learned.

The Repo is broken down into 5 Folders: 1 for each Module of the course:

CS-101: Intro to Programming

CS-102: Data Structures and Algorithims

CS-103: Databases

CS-104: Computer Architecutre 

CS-105: Discrete Math

I am currently finishing up CS-102


                 Best Case	      Worst Case	        Average Case	        Space Complexity
Bubble Sort	      Ω(n)	            O(n^2)	              O(n^2)	                O(1)
Merge Sort	      Ω(n log n)	      O(n log n)	          O(n log n)	            O(n)
Quicksort	        Ω(n log n)	      O(n^2)	              O(n log)	              O(log n)
